summary: Burning
abstract: Li Zhongxiu, a young man who aims to become a writer, usually lives on a part-time job. The father who runs the animal husbandry is not familiar with human feelings and is beset with lawsuits, forcing Zhong Xiu to run around to save his father. On this day, Zhong Xiu met her former classmate Shen Huimei in a large store. Huimei plans to travel to Africa in the near future, so she asks Zhong xiuzhao to see boil. Soon after Huimei returned home, a man named Ben got off the plane with her. Ben drives a Porsche and lives in a high-class apartment. He has no work and plays around. Compared with Zhong Xiu, he is like heaven and earth. I don't know why, Ben went into the life of Zhongxiu and Huimei, and told his new friends about his strange hobby. After the night when Zhong Xiu's family got together, Huimei seemed to have disappeared from the world... This film is based on Haruki Murakami's short story burning barn.
