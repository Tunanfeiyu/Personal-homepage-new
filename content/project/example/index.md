4. Practice process

First, from the school, under the guidance of the internship instructor, we visited and learned the Golden Bridge ICT hall and Jinqiao engineering machinery and construction engineering Museum, visited the whole development process from "big brother University" to now 5g, and studied the talent training plan of Huawei, the development status and Prospect of ICT Industry under the guidance of relevant teachers, and visited Dahan holding group of Dahan group "go ahead" In the theme museum of "great", I learned the corporate culture of Dahan group, then went to Hunan Xiangjiang intelligent technology innovation center, tried to take the unmanned bus, and at the same time, I learned about all kinds of unmanned vehicles and test methods under the explanation of relevant personnel, and learned and understood the development and development of unmanned transportation in Changsha and even Hunan Province and before the development Jing, then went to Hunan Science and Technology Information Technology Co., Ltd. to visit and learn its company's operation and development mode, and under the explanation of relevant personnel, I learned the operation mode of ICT industry, visited the working status and treatment of industry personnel on the spot, learned the ability requirements required by ICT Industry, and finally returned to school.



5. Summary and experience of practice

Although the internship lasted only one day, the impression and feeling that I had left was incomparable, which made me very encouraged. I believe that this internship is a good life experience for me, and I have made a strong preventive injection for me to go to work in the future, which has benefited me a lot.

Treat people sincerely and be willing to communicate with others. As an individual in society, human is a part of society. People should communicate and communicate with each other every moment. So it is very important to deal with the relationship between good people. No matter what work a person does, the first thing to do is to deal with his relationship with the people around him, and to integrate himself into his team better. To make Bai himself better integrated into the team, you must be honest and honest, treat your colleagues sincerely, and be happy to communicate with them. I feel this in the process of internship.

"A journey of thousands of miles starts from the bottom". Although this internship is short, it is very substantial for me. I think it plays a bridge role in my going to the society. The transition function and a very important experience of life will help me to go to work in the future. What this internship learned is not only the knowledge in books, but also the knowledge of doing things for people. To do things, we must learn to be human, understand the truth of being human, and how to get along with people is a basic problem in the society. For those who are going to enter the society two years later, there are many things to learn. They are my best teachers. They are called "three people do, there must be my teacher", and I can learn a lot of knowledge and truth from them. I think it's a precious asset in my life.

ICT is a comprehensive term, which covers all communication equipment or application software and various services and application software related to it. I learned 2G in ICT library, with digital voice transmission technology as the core. The user experience rate is 10kbps and the peak rate is 100kbps. It is generally defined as unable to directly transmit information such as email, software, etc.; it only has the technical specifications of mobile phone communication with calls and some transmission such as time and date. 3G is the third generation mobile communication technology, which is a kind of cellular mobile communication technology which supports high-speed data transmission. 3G service can transmit sound and data information at the same time. 3G is a generation of mobile communication system which combines wireless communication with multimedia communication such as the international Internet. 4G communication technology is the fourth generation mobile information system, which is a better improvement in 3G technology. Compared with 3G communication technology, 3G communication technology has a greater advantage. It combines WLAN technology and 3G communication technology well, which makes the transmission speed of image faster and lets the transmission diagram be made The image quality and image look clearer. 5g is the latest generation of cellular mobile communication technology, and also an extension after 4G, 3G and 2G systems. The performance goals of 5g are high data rate, low latency, energy saving, low cost, high system capacity and large-scale equipment connection. 5g uses small base station, one base station has only shoe box size, signal coverage scope of 250m, peak rate needs to meet gbit/s standard, to meet high-definition video, virtual reality and other large data transmission. The delay level of air interface should be about 1ms, which can meet the real-time application of automatic driving and telemedicine. It has a large network capacity, which provides the connection capacity of hundreds of billion devices, and meets the requirements of Internet of things communication. The spectral efficiency is more than 10 times higher than LTE. Under the continuous wide area coverage and high mobility, the user experience rate reaches 100mbit / s. The density of flow and connection number is greatly increased. The level of system coordination and intelligence is improved, which is manifested in the cooperative network with multi-user, multi-point, multi antenna and multi intake, and flexible and automatic adjustment between networks. 5g will be mainly used in the fields of vehicle networking, surgical operation, smart grid, etc., which has more obvious advantages and stronger functions in the practical application process.

During the visit to the theme Hall of "going to great" of Dahan holding group, their corporate culture impressed me deeply. The Han Dynasty was the man who stood on the top of the sky, and the Han Dynasty was a prosperous and prosperous Chinese, and the Han Dynasty was the Chinese descendants who did great things and made great achievements. The Han Dynasty was the man of the top heaven, and the top was the heaven under the leadership of the Communist Party. What he built was to serve the people wholeheartedly In the business area, their enterprises take social responsibility, realize the value of the enterprise, seek the interests of customers, and grow up with the employees as their mission. They adhere to the business philosophy of being virtuous, trustworthy, diligent and frugal, adhere to the principle of doing big things, willing to do small things, work first, and the eternal work concept of entrepreneurship. They will do everything best. The corporate culture of Dahan group also gives me enlightenment, which is more than the point It is to make their own contribution to the whole industry, to small said to do their own everything.

After visiting and learning from Hunan Xiangjiang intelligent technology innovation center, I learned that their company is an innovative enterprise for the construction and operation of new infrastructure projects such as intelligent network connection and intelligent transportation in the new area, mainly undertaking the operation of national intelligent network vehicle (Changsha) test area, application scenario construction and operation of Changsha intelligent network application scenario and huaweiyun innovation center operation, and is the city's intelligent network designated by the municipal government After taking the driverless bus, I am more proud of the third-party regulatory body of open road test of UnionPay, and I am also looking forward to my future professional knowledge learning. In Changsha, there are also unmanned taxis. Based on the continuous optimization of risk prevention and control mechanism, Changsha municipal government selects mature technology, practical scenarios and stable testing businesses, and focuses on accelerating the promotion of intelligence The general guiding ideology and basic working principles of the application demonstration project of energy grid automobile and the basic working principles of adhering to the first test, strengthening safety control, adhering to step-by-step and consolidating the test foundation are introduced in detail. The three types of application demonstration and operation demonstration scenarios of manned demonstration project, vehicle demonstration project and intelligent environmental sanitation demonstration project are introduced in detail, and the demonstration scope and the demonstration scope and the pilot operation projects are defined The application conditions, the nature of trial operation, the clear premise of security and control to support the legitimate compliance of enterprises for operation exploration. With the rapid development of the network, the Internet has become an important channel for people to quickly acquire, release and transmit information, and it plays an important role in people's politics, economy, life and other aspects. Therefore, the position of website construction in Internet application is obvious, it has become an important part of the information construction of government, enterprises and institutions, and has attracted people's attention.

This internship has given me a great inspiration. First, I want to understand the cultural background and development course and development direction of the whole industry, then to understand the corporate culture of the relevant enterprises, then experience the research results of the industry cutting-edge, and finally implement it to the ground, and really visit and understand a company; from big to small, from deep to shallow, from the development of the whole industry In the personal development, I have a complete understanding of the whole development of ICT industry for the first time, and also have a certain understanding of the big framework of ICT industry. It is the main part of teaching plan to realize internship, the second classroom to train our problem-solving ability, and is a direct understanding of the major, laying a foundation for further learning professional knowledge; this cognitive practice has opened my heart The fog of ICT industry in China has made me have a more stereoscopic and intuitive understanding of ICT industry, and also enables me to better combine learning and practice. On the other hand, it also consolidated and deepened the knowledge I learned in the classroom, and made my theoretical knowledge more solid. At the same time, I also let me go out of ivory tower to contact society in advance, to some extent, reduce my fear of society, let me want to realize my own value, realize real learning thinking, learning has its use and learning has effect.
